/*
	‚≠êÔ∏è in golang every goroutine would have its own stack

	‚≠êÔ∏èlets say a goroutine wants to call a function...
		what would happen is that an isolated memory space...
		would be created on the stack and assigned....
		to that funcion call which would be called ...
		that functions's "frame boundary"

	‚≠êÔ∏èa function call provided with some data arguments...
		would require a transition of data...
		from the caller function's stack frame...
		to the newly called function's stack frame.

	‚≠êÔ∏èin golang this transition of data between
		two stack frames is always done "by value"...
		meaning The value will be copied,...
		passed and placed into the new frame.

	‚≠êÔ∏èif we do wish to "share a value" however between 2 function calls...
		and their stack frames. We would use something called...
		a "pointer" to that value.

	‚≠êÔ∏è"Pointers" allow us to share a value with a function so...
		the function can read and write to that value...
		even though the value does not exist directly inside its own frame.

	‚≠êÔ∏èA pointer variable would store the address of...
		the value it is pointing to allowing the executing...
		functionn frame to have indirect memory access to...
		that value outside of it's own boundry frame.

	‚≠êÔ∏èFor every type that is declared....
		either by you or the language itself,...
		a compliment pointer type would also be declared.

//SECTION 2: üå∫Heap & EscapeAnalysisüå∫
// ========================================
//NOTES :
/*
	üå∏the data of our code in the go language get stored...
	either in the stack or the heap

	üå∏the go compiler is designed so that it prefers storage of...
	data on the stack over the storage on the heap considering...
	the higher perfomance the stack memory has

	üå∏but in some certain scenarios it does however...
	decide to alocate its memory on the heap and...
	these scenarios would be :

	üå∏-1: when the data would be to large to fit in the stack

	üå∏-2: when the size of the data is not known in advanced

	üå∏-3: in the case of interface type variables value assignments

	üå∏-4: when the value created is being "shared up" the stack

	üå∏"sharing up" a value would be the scenario where a called function...
	tries to returns a pointer to a value which would be stored...
	on its own stack frame. considering after the return statment the stack...
	frame of a function call would be considered invalid then the storage of...
	that value on the stack would create integrity issues in our program...
	and there for the value would "escape"/be stored in the heap.

	üå∏another thing to watch out for is the concept of "inline"ing...
	a function call, which is an optimization techniche used by...
	the compiler.

	üå∏when the compiler sees a small function being called...
	it might deside to just place the instructions of the called function...
	directly inside the caller function, effectivly saving the overload...
	of performing a function call.

	üå∏this "inline"ing strategy could also effect the place ...
	a value is assigned to and the memory allocations.

	üå∏the algorythm used by the compiler to determine whether a...
	value is indeed being shared up or not is called "escape analysis"...
	and if the compiler has any doubt that the value could...
	possibly be refrence in any direct or indirect way higher up...
	the stack it won't hesitate storing it in the heap.
